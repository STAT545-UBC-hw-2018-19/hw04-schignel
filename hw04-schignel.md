Overview
--------

**Goal:** Solidify data wrangling skills by working on some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.

**Assignment:** This is a “choose your own adventure”-style assignment, where you are expected to do the following two things:

-   Pick one of the data reshaping prompts and do it.
-   Pick one of the join prompts and do it.

It is fine to work with a new dataset and/or create variations on these problem themes.

### Activity \#1: Cheat Sheet

I have developed a separate [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-schignel/blob/master/Reshaping_in_tidyR_-_cheat_sheet.md), which is stored in the Homework 4 repository.
